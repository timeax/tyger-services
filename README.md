# Digital Growth Platform (DGP) – Overview

## 1. What Is the DGP?
**The DGP is an all‑in‑one, plug‑and‑play ecosystem that helps brands *acquire, convert, and retain* customers online.**  
It fuses a multi‑service order engine (SMM, web & app builds, branding, SEO, etc.) with real‑time collaboration tools, automated payments + escrow, analytics, and a rich plugin framework—so clients scale from “idea” to “impact” without switching tools or vendors.

## 3. Feature Breakdown

### 3.1 Multi‑Service Order Engine
- **Dynamic catalog:** SMM boosts, web dev packages, design kits, SEO retainers, more.  
- **Smart intake:** Each service defines required fields & validations (no vague briefs).  
- **Order lifecycle:** Pending → Active → Completed/Failed, with drip‑feed and refill logic.  
- **Snapshot & auditing:** Every payload is snapshotted—perfect for support and refunds.

### 3.2 Plugin Architecture
- **SMM Handlers:** Standardizes wildly different panel APIs. Add a new provider in minutes.  
- **Payment Gateways:** Drop‑in plugins (Stripe, PayPal, Flutterwave, *internal wallet*).  
- **Future‑proof:** Same pattern will power virtual accounts, AI tools, and more.

### 3.3 Wallet & Escrow System
- **Wallet gateway (`is_wallet = true`):** Lets users pay with on‑site credit.  
- **Escrow holds:** Funds are locked when paying for orders; released in slices as work finishes.  
- **Automatic reconciliations:** Partial releases, refunds, expiry‑based payouts.

### 3.4 Collaboration Suite
- **Ticketing:** Category‑based tickets with required custom fields, priority & status enums.  
- **Live chat:** Real‑time room auto‑created for dev/design projects.  
- **Contract manager:** e‑sign, file storage, status tracking—linked straight to the order.  
- **ReviewTask system:** Multi‑role reviews, approvals, and help‑requests à la GitHub PRs.

### 3.5 Service Vault & Versioning
Store internal service drafts, track iterations, role‑based visibility (worker, reviewer, approver, supervisor, super).  
Collaboration branches ensure edits never touch the main version until approved.

### 3.6 Analytics & Dashboards
- Unified metrics: spend, traffic, conversion, social growth, service health.  
- Drill‑downs per client, per campaign, per time range.  
- Exportable CSV / scheduled email digests.
